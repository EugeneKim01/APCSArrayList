# APCSArrayList
For this project, we're going to write a special kind of class called a *data structure*. A data structure is a class used to organize data. 

Right now the only data structure we know is an array. The array has one major downside, it has a fixed length. We will build a List which is similar to an array -- it can store multiple elements of the same type, and elements can be read and written using indices. However, we can also insert to the end of the list and into the middle of the list, and the list will automatically grow in size as needed.

The class should be named APArrayIntList and it should implement the interface APIntList. An interface is like a contract. When a class implements an interface, it promises to implement all the methods in the interface. We will use this promise to write test cases for your class.
